   [/5] Basic Query that starts at root server and works to an
        authoritative server in a straightforward path.
        (e.g. www.cs.ubc.ca to a root name server)

   [/5] A basic type query that results in a CNAME and the need to
        restart the search for the alias. (e.g. prep.ai.mit.edu)

   [/3] A query that returns a name server to use where the name
        server's address isn't provided. (e.g. www.stanford.edu)

   [/3] A complicated lookup series that potentially involves multiple
        cnames and DNS server name lookups (finance.google.ca)

   [/3] Can deal with information in the additional information
        section when not all of it is of interest/use
        (e.g. groups.yahoo.com)

   [/3] Can deal with unconventional but valid response records
        (e.g. uncompressed RR names, compression of the query name).

   [/3] Adds all resource records retrieved from the server to the
        cache.

   [/2] Uses cached data when available (for a regular query).

   [/3] Uses cached data when available (for a CNAME query).

   [/2] The TTL reported is the last TTL from the A (or AAAA) record 
        when a CNAME is involved.

   [/2] Uses IPv4 nameserver even when IPv6 request is done.

   [/2] If a query returns more than IP address all IP addresses
        are printed.

        records.

   [/2] Timeout - nameserver doesn't respond
